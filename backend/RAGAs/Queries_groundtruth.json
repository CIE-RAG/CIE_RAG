A cost-driven model focuses on minimizing expenses, offering low prices (e.g., budget airlines).

  {
    "query": "Why is it particularly important for startup founders to establish an ethical culture from the outset, rather than focusing solely on profitability?",
    "ground_truth": "It is crucial for startup founders to establish an ethical culture from the outset because integrity and reputation are fundamental for long-term business success. Unethical decisions, even driven by competitive pressure, can have big negative consequences and 'bring down the entire effort' [51, 52].

    "ground_truth": "The BMC offers a 10,000-foot, dynamic, and visual overview for easier iteration, while a traditional BP is more strategic and detailed, including financials [80]. They are complementary because BMC can be used for quick analysis and ideation, and its hypotheses can then be validated and elaborated upon in the more detailed Business Plan, making their use 'situational' depending on the need and audience [80, 81]."

    "ground_truth": "'Embracing Uncertainty' is a core commonality between Effectuation and the Entrepreneurial Mindset, particularly the trait of being 'Comfortable with uncertainty' [43, 92]. Effectuation's 'Lemonade Principle' explicitly advises expert entrepreneurs to embrace and leverage surprises rather than trying to avoid them, turning 'bad news' into clues for new markets [48, 49].

Module M8 explicitly lists 'AI: Reimagining How We Innovate' in the course outline [58], and M12's recap reiterates 'Leverage Technology and Innovation' by incorporating AI or digital tools to enhance a solution [93].
