M1 - Why Startups Fail
Startup -> search for repeatable and scalable business model
Why Conventional Product Development Fails
The Lean Approach
BMC (reference)
Startups != small companies
This approach focuses on the business plan first and testing later -> BIG assumption: customers +
market already available
Focus on implementation/tech instead of idea
Linear process
Most startups fail from lack of customers rather than a failure of their product development
Components:
1. Business Model Canvas
2. Customer Development
3. Agile Engineering
Pivot: Substantive change to business model component
Iteration: Minor, incremental change
No plan survives without contacting customers first
Create MVP -> simplest version of product that validates your business model
Check for scalable business model

Customer Segments:
Which customers/users you are serving
Mass market, niche market, diversified market (two or more unrelated groups), segmented market
(distinct groups of customers with distinct requirements)
1. Segmented Market
A market that is divided into distinct groups of customers with different needs, preferences, or
characteristics.
Businesses tailor their products or services to meet the specific demands of each segment.
Example: An airline offers economy, business, and first-class tickets to cater to different customer
groups.
1. Diversified Market
A market where a business targets two or more unrelated customer groups with different needs.
The company offers distinct products or services to serve these unrelated groups.
Example: Amazon serves individual consumers with e-commerce while offering cloud computing
services to businesses.
1. Mass Market
A market where a business targets a broad customer base with a single product or service, aiming
to reach as many people as possible.
The focus is on high volume, standardization, and economies of scale.
Example: Coca-Cola sells a standardized product worldwide, appealing to a wide audience.

1. Niche Market
A market where a business focuses on a small, specialized group of customers with specific
needs or interests.
Products or services are highly tailored to meet the preferences of this group.
Example: A company that sells luxury vegan leather bags caters to eco-conscious consumers in
the luxury fashion niche.
How you're reaching the customer and what they find convenient
Eg: Web, own store, retail/distribution channels etc.
What you're offering the customer and whether they care
Types of relationships established with customer (personal/automates/acquisitive etc)
Customer acquisition -> customer retention -> Boost sales (upsell)
Where and how you're going to make money from; how much customers will be willing to pay and
in what way
Two types of revenue:
Transactional: One time payment for a purchase
Recurring: Repeating payment over a period of time
Minimise costs as much as possible without compromising quality
Two types of costing:
Fixed: Price remains the same regardless of volume produced
Variable: Price varies with amount of goods produced
Economy of Scale: Cost advantages achieved as a business increases production, leading to lower
costs per unit due to higher efficiency
Economy of Scope: Cost advantages gained by a business from producing multiple products or
services using the same resources or processes
