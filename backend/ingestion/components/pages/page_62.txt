Zappos
Customer Discovery: Zappos, an online shoe and clothing retailer, has built its success on a
foundation of exceptional customer service. In the early stages, founder Tony Hsieh recognized the
importance of understanding customer needs and expectations. He personally spoke with customers
to gain insights into their preferences and pain points.
Impact: Zappos prioritised customer satisfaction and went beyond selling products by focusing on
creating a delightful shopping experience. This customer-centric approach paid off, and Zappos
became known for its outstanding customer service and loyalty. In 2009, Amazon acquired Zappos for
over $1 billion, recognising the company's commitment to customer satisfaction.
