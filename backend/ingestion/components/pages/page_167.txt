Why Startups Fail – Some Key Aspects

“Startups fail when they are not solving a market problem”
"We were not solving a large enough problem that we could

great reputation as a tough leader, great expertise, great advisors, 
etc, but what we didn’t have was technology or business 
model that solved a pain point in a scalable way”
