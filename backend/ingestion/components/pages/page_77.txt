Selecting a Good Problem Statement / Opportunity
• Problem: Is this a ‘good’* & real problem (today, not in the distant future)?
• Need: Who needs this (customer) and what benefit is the customer seeking?
• Business: Viable from a ‘business’ (think BMC) point-of-view? Competitive Landscape?
• Execution: Is there a path for you/team to get started on above? 
• Why your team would be an ideal founding team for this opportunity?
• Testable: Can this problem & solution be tested (from a customer dev perspective)?
* Use TIPSC to narrow down on opportunity: Timely, Important, Profitable, Solvable, Context
