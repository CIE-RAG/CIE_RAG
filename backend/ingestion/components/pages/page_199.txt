Type: Technology vs. Market (Examples)
EIE - II
Architectural Innovation
(Reconfiguring existing tech for a new market or purpose)
Example: Sony’s Walkman – Sony took existing components 
(cassette players, compact speakers, and headphones) and 
reconfigured them into a portable music player, creating a 
new market for personal audio devices.
Incremental Innovation
(Small improvements to existing products or processes)
Example: Apple's iPhone updates – Each new iPhone model 
brings incremental improvements, such as better cameras, 
faster processors, and enhanced battery life, without 
fundamentally changing the smartphone industry.
Radical Innovation 
(Breakthroughs that fundamentally change industries)
Example: The first personal computer (PC) – The 
introduction of PCs by companies like IBM and Apple 
revolutionized computing by making it accessible to individuals 
and businesses, fundamentally changing the way people work 
and communicate.
Disruptive Innovation
(Starts as a low-end/niche product; eventually upends an 
entire industry)
•Example: Netflix’s streaming service – Initially, Netflix 
offered DVD rentals by mail, targeting a niche market. 
Eventually, it shifted to streaming, disrupting traditional cable 
TV and movie rental businesses like Blockbuster.
