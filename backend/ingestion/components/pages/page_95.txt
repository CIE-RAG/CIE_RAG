How do you Test your Hypotheses (Steps)
1. Capture your hypotheses (assumptions/opinions)
2. Design the Experiments to test assumptions/opinions
3. Test your hypotheses by conducting your key hypotheses
•
Run the Experiments (“Get out of the Building”, Customer interviews, not surveys)
•
Gather Data/Results from the Experiments (hypothesis is validated or invalidated)
•
What insights did you gather? How does this affect your problem/ solution/ BMC/ etc?
Tip:
For your experiments, recommend having some artifact (Pretotype/Prototype/MVP)
Artifact can be: Paper, Digital, Native (in order of ascending fidelity: low -> high)
