Dropbox
Customer Discovery: Drew Houston, the founder of Dropbox, initially created a video demo of the
product and posted it on a technology forum to gauge interest and gather feedback. The
overwhelmingly positive response from potential customers helped validate the idea and demonstrate
the demand for an easy-to-use file storage and sharing solution.
Impact: Armed with valuable customer feedback, Dropbox was launched in 2007, offering cloud-
based file storage and synchronisation. The company's customer-centric approach, which focused on
addressing user needs and pain points, contributed to its rapid growth and widespread adoption.
Today, Dropbox is a leading cloud storage provider with millions of users worldwide.
