            "response": "Based on the provided context, startups fail for several key reasons, as highlighted in the *Essentials of Innovation & Entrepreneurship (EIE) - II* course materials. Here are the primary causes:\n\n1. **Not Solving a Market Problem**:\n   - Many startups fail because they do not address a significant or scalable market need. As noted on **Page 167**, startups fail when they \"are not solving a large enough problem that they could universally serve with a scalable solution.\" Even with strong technology, expertise, or advisors, the lack of a scalable solution to a real pain point leads to failure.\n\n2. **Lack of Customers**:\n   - **Page 22** emphasizes that \"More startups fail from a lack of customers than from a failure of product development.\" This underscores the importance of validating demand early.\n\n3. **Conventional Product Development Model Flaws**:\n   - The traditional approach (Idea \u2192 Team \u2192 Product \u2192 Market/Sell) assumes customers and markets are ready, which is often not true (**Page 21**). Startups are not smaller versions of large companies, and linear processes can lead to misalignment with customer needs.\n\n4. **Failure to Reach the Intended Market**:\n   - **Page 169** mentions that products fail when sales, marketing, or distribution efforts fail to reach the intended market or when the product fails to meet user expectations.\n\n5. **Lean Startup Method as a Solution**:\n   - The context suggests adopting the **Lean Startup Method** (e.g., **Page 23**) to focus on customers and markets from \"Day 0\" rather than relying solely on product development.\n\n6. **Other Common Reasons (CB Insights)**:\n   - While not detailed in the context, **Page 166** references \"Top 10 Reasons Startups Fail\" and \"Next 10 Reasons Startups Fail,\" implying broader factors like mismanagement, cash flow issues, or competition.\n\n### Key Takeaway:\nThe context highlights that startups often fail due to a disconnect between their offerings and market needs, emphasizing the need for customer-centric approaches like the Lean Startup Method. For a comprehensive list of reasons, additional details from CB Insights (referenced but not fully provided in the context) would be necessary.",

            "response": "Based on the provided context, a **Business Model Canvas (BMC)** is described as a **prototyping (not planning) tool** used in the Lean Startup methodology. It helps startups and entrepreneurs structure and visualize their business model by breaking it down into key components. The BMC is divided into three main aspects:\n\n1. **Desirability**:\n   - Customer Value Proposition\n   - Customer Segments\n   - Customer Relationship\n   - Channels\n\n2. **Feasibility**:\n   - Key Activities\n   - Key Resources\n   - Key Partnerships\n\n3. **Viability**:\n   - Cost\n   - Revenue Model\n\nThe BMC is used to capture hypotheses about the business (e.g., customer needs, market size, pricing) and is iteratively refined based on feedback and testing (Context 2, Page 113; Context 1, Page 28).\n\nIf you need further details or examples, the context suggests creating or updating a BMC for a specific opportunity (Context 2, Page 114).",
