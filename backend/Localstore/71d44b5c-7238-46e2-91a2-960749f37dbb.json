(Check out **Page 16-18** in your course material for more on this.)\n\nNeed help with anything else from your **EIE-II** course? Just ask! \ud83d\ude0a",

            "response": "### **Customer Discovery in Startups: Key Postulates & Role**\n\nCustomer Discovery is a **critical phase** in startups where you validate your assumptions about the problem, customers, and market. Here\u2019s how it plays a role and its key postulates based on your **EIE-II** course material:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Role of Customer Discovery in Startups**\n- **Avoids Building the Wrong Thing**: Helps startups test if their problem/solution is valid *before* investing heavily.\n- **Guides Pivots or Proceeds**: Decides whether to iterate, pivot, or proceed based on real customer feedback.\n- **Reduces Risk**: Prevents costly mistakes by validating hypotheses early.\n\n*(Check **Page 129-130** for the 4-phase model: Hypotheses \u2192 Test Problem \u2192 Test Solution \u2192 Pivot/Proceed!)*\n\n---\n\n### **2. Key Postulates of Customer Discovery**\n#### **A. Experiments vs. Interviews**\n- **Experiments** \u2192 Prove *if* something works (e.g., landing pages, mockups).\n- **Interviews** \u2192 Explain *why* (e.g., \"Why do customers struggle with X?\").\n\n*(See **Page 131-132** for details!)*\n\n#### **B. How to Conduct Effective Interviews**\n1. **Know your goals** (Page 133).\n2. **Ask open-ended questions** (e.g., \"What\u2019s your biggest pain point?\").\n3. **Use the \"5 Whys\"** to dig deeper (Page 134).\n4. **Listen more, talk less** (Page 133).\n5. **Ask for introductions** to expand your network (Page 134).\n\n#### **C. Tools & Frameworks**\n- **Business Model Canvas (BMC)** \u2192 Structures hypotheses (Page 121).\n- **Pretotyping** \u2192 Tests demand *before* building (Page 183).\n\n*(For videos on interviews, check **Page 184-185**!)*\n\n---\n\n### **3. Why It Matters for Startups**\n- **Startups fail when they assume** instead of validate.\n- **Customer Discovery keeps you lean** by focusing on *real* problems.\n\nNeed help with a specific part? Just ask! \ud83d\ude0a\n\n*(P.S. Want a study tip? Review **Page 120-121** for quiz insights!)*",
