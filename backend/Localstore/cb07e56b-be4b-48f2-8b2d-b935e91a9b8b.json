Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll explore:\n\n---\n\n#### **1. Why Customer Discovery?**\n- **Avoid the \"Build It and They Will Come\" Trap**: Many startups fail because they assume demand exists without testing it.\n- **Lean Startup Principle**: \"Get out of the building\" and talk to customers before building anything!\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Key Steps in Customer Discovery**\n- **Hypothesis Testing**: Formulate hypotheses (e.g., \"At least 10% of gym-goers will pay for a VR fitness app\").\n- **Interviewing Customers**: Ask open-ended questions to understand pain points and needs.\n- **Validating Assumptions**: Use data (not just gut feelings) to confirm or reject your hypotheses.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Tools & Techniques**\n- **XYZ Hypothesis Framework**:\n  - *\"At least X% of Y will Z.\"*\n  - Example: *\"At least 15% of college students will use a study app that gamifies learning.\"*\n- **Pretotyping vs. Prototyping**:\n  - **Pretotype**: Cheap, fast tests (e.g., landing pages, mockups) to gauge interest.\n  - **Prototype**: A functional version (built only after validation).\n\n---\n\n#### **4. Common Pitfalls to Avoid**\n- **Confirmation Bias**: Only listening to people who agree with you.\n- **Skipping Validation**: Building a product before knowing if anyone wants it.\n\n---\n\n#### **5. How It Helps Your Startup**\n- **Saves Time & Money**: Avoids wasted effort on unvalidated ideas.\n- **Builds Confidence**: Gives you real evidence to pitch to investors.\n\n---\n\n**Want to dive deeper?** Check out topics like:\n- **\"Why Startups Fail\"** (M1)\n- **\"Pretotyping vs. Prototyping\"** (M5)\n- **\"XYZ Hypothesis Framework\"** (M4)\n\nGot a startup idea?
