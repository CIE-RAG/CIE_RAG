Customer-Centric Approach (aka \"Stop Guessing, Start Listening!\")**\n- **Problem First!** What\u2019s the *real* pain point in fashion? (e.g., \"I hate fast fashion waste\" or \"I can\u2019t find stylish, affordable workwear\"?)\n- **Talk to 100 people** (yes, *100!*)\u2014friends, strangers, even your grandma. Ask: *\"What\u2019s your biggest fashion struggle?\"*\n- **Validate your idea** with *evidence*, not just vibes. (No \"faith-based\" entrepreneurship here!)\n\n### **2. MVP (Minimum Viable Product) \u2013 Build the *Simplest* Thing That Works**\n- **Prototype fast!** Start with a *basic* version (e.g., a digital lookbook, a small batch of handmade items, or a pop-up shop).\n- **Test assumptions**: Does your target audience *actually* want this? (Spoiler: They might say \"yes\" to your face but ghost you later. *Test!*)\n\n### **3. Iterate Like a Pro (aka \"Fail Fast, Learn Faster\")**\n- **Get feedback** and *pivot* if needed. (Example: If customers love your eco-friendly fabric but hate the price, tweak your model!)\n- **Embrace change**\u2014your first idea *will* evolve. (Pinterest started as a *chrome extension*, remember?)\n\n### **4. Build Your Dream Team (aka \"Find Your Fashion Squad\")**\n- **Scout teammates** who complement you (e.g., a tech whiz for your e-commerce, a marketing guru for branding).\n- **Define roles early** (Mkt, Tech, Biz, etc.)\u2014no one wants a *chaos* startup!\n\n### **5. Scale with Lean Principles (aka \"Don\u2019t Spend Like a Billionaire\")**\n- **Use digital tools** (GenAI for design, social media for marketing).\n- **Focus on *repeatable* success**\u2014can you sell 100 units *consistently* before scaling?\n\n**Bonus Tip:** Check out the *CIE Summer Internship* (Page 13) to build your prototype with support!\n\n*P.S.
