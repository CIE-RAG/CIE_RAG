It helps startups and entrepreneurs quickly map out key aspects of their business in a structured way.\n\n### **Key Components of BMC (Based on Context):**\n1. **Desirability** (Customer-Focused):\n   - *Customer Value Proposition*: What problem does your solution solve?\n   - *Customer Segments*: Who are your target customers?\n   - *Customer Relationships & Channels*: How will you engage and reach them?\n\n2. **Feasibility** (Execution-Focused):\n   - *Key Activities & Resources*: What will you do and what do you need?\n   - *Key Partnerships*: Who can help you succeed?\n\n3. **Viability** (Financial-Focused):\n   - *Cost Structure & Revenue Model*: How will you make money?\n\n### **Why Use a BMC?**\n- It\u2019s **lean** (avoids waste by testing assumptions early).\n- It\u2019s **iterative** (you update it as you learn more).\n- It\u2019s **collaborative** (great for team alignment).\n\n### **Pro Tip from Context:**\nStart with **hypotheses** (educated guesses) and refine the BMC as you validate them through customer discovery!\n\nNeed help building one?

A **Business Model Canvas (BMC)** will help you structure your startup efficiently. Here\u2019s how:\n\n### **1. Desirability (Customer-Focused)**\n- **Customer Value Proposition**:\n  - *\"Affordable, trendy, pre-loved fashion for students with fast shipping and easy returns.\"*\n- **Customer Segments**:\n  - College students (18-24) who love fashion but hate high prices.\n- **Customer Relationships & Channels**:\n  - Social media (Instagram, TikTok) for engagement + WhatsApp groups for quick updates.\n\n### **2.
